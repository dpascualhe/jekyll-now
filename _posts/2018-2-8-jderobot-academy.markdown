As an assignment for one of my master's degree subjects (**robotic vision**), we have to build a few vision/robotics based solutions for real world problems. These applications will be built aided by JdeRobot tools, within the framework of its teaching platform, [**JdeRobot Academy**](https://github.com/JdeRobot/Academy). It contains exercises related with autonomous driving, drones, navigation...

I will be posting here about the development of each application as well as videos and images to show the results achieved. Stay tuned!
