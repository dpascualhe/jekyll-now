[**JdeRobot**](https://jderobot.org/Main_Page) is a middleware that provides drivers and tools in order to ease the interaction between hardware and software components. Communication is enabled by Ice and it's ROS compatible. And rocks! And matters!

As an assignment for one of my master's degree subjects (**robotic vision**), we have to build a few vision/robotics based solutions for real world problems. These applications will be built aided by JdeRobot tools, within the framework of its teaching platform, [**JdeRobot Academy**](https://github.com/JdeRobot/Academy). It contains exercises related with autonomous driving, drones, navigation...

I will be posting here about the development of each application as well as videos and images to show the results achieved. Stay tuned!
